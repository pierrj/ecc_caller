## USAGE ##
# generates a bam file from fastq files
# filters the bam file to contigs of interest
# can be replaced by any filtered bam file
# options:
# -g path to bwa genome database name
# -1 path to read 1 file
# -2 path to read 2 file
# -s sample name/output prefix
# -t threads
# -m mapfile with names of contigs of interest, as written in the fasta file used to make bwa genome database

# cutadapt uses specific adapters here, will be replaced with trimmomatic which predicts adapters automatically eventually
# nextseq-trim option is necessary for nextseq data
cutadapt -j ${THREADS} -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA -A AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT --nextseq-trim=20 -o tmp.trimmed.seqprep.${SAMPLE}_R1.fastq -p tmp.trimmed.seqprep.${SAMPLE}_R2.fastq ${READONE} ${READTWO}

# sort and index for filtering
